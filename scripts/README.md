## üîß Configuration

Before running deployment scripts, ensure you have:
- Set up environment variables (see `../backend/.env`)
- Configured Firebase (see `../docs/setup_firebase.md`)
- Installed all dependencies
- Verified database connections

## üìù Notes

- Always run `deploy-check.sh` before deploying to catch configuration issues
- Scripts assume they are run from the project root directory
- For Windows users: Use PowerShell or Git Bash to run `.sh` scripts, or use the `.bat` equivalent
- Check the `../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions

## üö® Troubleshooting

If scripts fail to execute:
1. Check file permissions: `chmod +x *.sh`
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check logs for specific error messages
5. Refer to `../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for common issues
