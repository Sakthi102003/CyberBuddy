# Firebase Authentication Integration

## Overview
The CyberBuddy application now uses Firebase Authentication instead of manual user registration/login.

## Features
- **Email/Password Authentication**: Users can sign up and sign in with email and password
- **Google Sign-In**: One-click authentication with Google accounts
- **Automatic User Management**: Firebase users are automatically created in the local database
- **Secure Token Verification**: Firebase ID tokens are verified on the backend
- **API Key Management**: Users can still manage their own API keys securely

## Frontend Changes
- Replaced manual auth forms with Firebase auth
- Added Google Sign-In button
- Integrated Firebase Auth state management
- Automatic token refresh handling

## Backend Changes
- Added Firebase token verification
- Modified user database schema to support Firebase UIDs
- Maintained existing API key and chat session functionality
- Fallback token verification for development

## Configuration
The Firebase configuration is already set up with:
- Project ID: cyberbuddy-da99a
- Authentication methods: Email/Password, Google
- Auto-user creation in local database

## Development Notes
- Firebase Admin SDK uses fallback verification for development
- Production deployment will need proper service account credentials
- All existing features (chat, API keys, sessions) work seamlessly with Firebase auth
