# CORS FIX - Deployment Instructions

## Problem
After deployment, the frontend on Render (`https://cyberbuddy-x7zp.onrender.com`) was getting CORS errors when trying to access the backend (`https://cyberbuddy-backend-8tif.onrender.com`) because the backend's CORS policy didn't include the production frontend URL.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `backend/config.py`
Added the production frontend URL to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
- Added `https://cyberbuddy-x7zp.onrender.com`
- Added support for dynamic `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable

### 2. Deploy to Render

#### Option A: Push to Git (Recommended)
```powershell
git add backend/config.py backend/.env.example
git commit -m "Fix: Add production frontend URL to CORS allowed origins"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy your backend when it detects the push.

#### Option B: Set Environment Variable on Render
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your backend service (`cyberbuddy-backend-8tif`)
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add environment variable:
   - Key: `FRONTEND_URL`
   - Value: `https://cyberbuddy-x7zp.onrender.com`
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Manually trigger a redeploy

### 3. Verify the Fix

After redeployment:
1. Visit your frontend: `https://cyberbuddy-x7zp.onrender.com`
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Try logging in or using the chat
4. Check the Console tab - CORS errors should be gone
5. Check the Network tab - API requests should return 200 status codes

## Testing Locally

If you want to test locally first:

1. Make sure your backend `.env` file has:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. Run backend:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

3. Run frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Important Notes

- The backend now accepts requests from both local development URLs and your production frontend
- If you change your frontend URL on Render, update the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- The CORS configuration uses wildcards (`*`) for methods and headers for maximum compatibility

## Troubleshooting

If CORS errors persist after deployment:

1. **Check Render Logs**
   - Go to Render dashboard â†’ Backend service â†’ Logs
   - Look for startup messages confirming CORS configuration

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Ensure the latest commit with the CORS fix was deployed
   - Check the "Events" tab on Render to see deployment status

3. **Hard Refresh Frontend**
   - Clear browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - The browser might be caching the old preflight responses

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set on Render
   - Optionally verify `FRONTEND_URL` if you added it

5. **Test Backend Directly**
   - Visit `https://cyberbuddy-backend-8tif.onrender.com/`
   - You should see: `{"message": "CyberBuddy API is running", ...}`
   - Visit `https://cyberbuddy-backend-8tif.onrender.com/health`
   - You should see: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push the changes
2. Wait for Render to redeploy (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Test your application
4. If everything works, you're done! ðŸŽ‰
